# Attempt at Quest Challenge by Ryan Findley

This will document the steps I took in attempting to complete the Quest Challenge presented to me by Rearc. The code will be pushed to a GitHub repository [https://github.com/r-findley/quest-rearc] for sharing with the Rearc team.

## Steps Taken To Complete

1. My thought process began with simply creating a separate git repository and copying the Quest code into this to give me my own implementation to work with. This was committed as my initial commit with this first step written for the README.
